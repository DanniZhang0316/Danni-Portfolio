# Projects
## Machine Learning:
### 1. Automatic Bee Detection Using YOLOv10 (client: Gratheon)         
Developed a ML pipeline for automatic detection of worker and drone bees from live video frames, achieving 97% precision and 93% recall.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented high-resolution image tiling by slicing 3840×1080 images into three overlapping tiles.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied copy-paste augmentation by extracting and augmenting drone instances and reinserting them into training images, improving mAP@50–95 from 0.63 to 0.66.
responsibility: YOLOv10 trainning, data preprocessing and augmentation
skills: Roboflow, Python
